<h2>Abstract</h2>
Parking management in the urban areas has become a rising concern for many. Improper management of the space allotted for vehicle parking has always led to reduced availability of parking lots of vehicles. In addition to this, huge parking spaces such as multi-storeyed parking facilities may face difficulty in keeping track of the available parking slots. To combat the challenging issue at hand, this project aims to propose an innovative way to utilize the technology of the Internet of Things (IoT) and build a smart system that can track parking space occupancy and minimize the search time of parking lots for drivers and improve the overall parking experience. We propose an induction loop vehicle detector system that consists of an induction loop made out of copper enameled wires, a resistor, a capacitor, a diode, and an LED. In addition to this, we have used a database to keep a record of the parking slots and their availability. A front end is designed for the user to view the currently available parking slot. The admin can view all the parking slots and their current status (i.e. available or occupied).

<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
Traditional methods of parking detection, such as manually allotting the available space are often inaccurate and unreliable, leading to misdirection of drivers and an increase in the time spent to search for a parking space. Another huge problem is that without a proper system to manage the real-time occupancy data drivers may occupy a space thatâ€™s not meant for parking due to a misdirection through many obstructions such as means of human error or more. The current parking experience is often frustrating and time-consuming, due to the lack of real-time guidance and efficient parking allocation. To address these challenges the project proposes an innovative approach using an induction loop sensor as the base and combining the IoT technology to improve the overall parking experience.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In conclusion, the development and implementation of a smart parking system using an induction loop detector represent a significant leap forward in addressing modern parking challenges. The project successfully demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing this technology to create a more efficient and user-friendly parking environment. Previous attempts to build such a system were mostly based on either of camera, IR sensor or magnetic sensor as the detecting sensors. However, these come with their own drawbacks. Magnetic sensors, which identify metallic objects by disturbing the Earth's magnetic field, face challenges in detecting stationary vehicles and have constraints in terms of detection zones. Surveillance video cameras encounter accuracy problems, particularly in congested conditions, where they may have difficulty distinguishing smaller vehicles obscured by larger ones. Likewise, infrared (IR) sensors are prone to reflections from sunlight, interference from atmospheric particles, and sensitivity to water presence in fog, haze, rain, and snow. They are also impacted by obstructive elements like smoke and dust. <br>
In essence, the smart parking system using an induction loop detector not only addresses the immediate need for efficient parking management but also lays the groundwork for future developments in intelligent transportation systems. As urban areas continue to face growing challenges in parking availability, this project serves as a noteworthy contribution towards creating smarter and more sustainable urban spaces.

<h2>Future Scope</h2>
The circuit can be modified to meet the specific requirements of the project for future development as well. For example, multiple induction loop sensors can be connected to the Arduino Uno to monitor multiple parking spaces. Additionally, the LED can be replaced with a more powerful light source, such as a traffic lights or a sign, to provide more visible parking occupancy information. <br>
The thresholds for detecting the presence of a vehicle in a parking slot can be varied to suit different types of vehicles depending upon various factors such as the metal content in the vehicle body, the size of vehicle, etc. <br>
The proposed work can also be integrated with a payment system that charges vehicles relevant parking fees upon detection of their exit from the parking space. Contactless payment methods can be enabled that provide a seamless experience for users when they pay the fees. One can utilize technologies like License Plate Recognition to automatically recognize and link the vehicle to the user's account. <br>
In addition to this, the web application can also include a map that navigates you to the available parking slot using technologies like GPS so that the driver can easily park their vehicle therefore avoiding any latencies caused due to the driver figuring out their way to the available parking slot.
